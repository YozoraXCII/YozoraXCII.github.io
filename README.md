# Purpose
<p>This tool is designed for PMM users to help them find images that can be used as posters for collections or other Plex media.
This tool uses Google's Advanced Image Search to specifically search for images that are in portrait mode, making them easier to use for posters.

# Searching

1) Larger than 2 megapixels (minimum 1080 wide and 1920 tall)
2) Larger than 4 megapixels (minimum 1520 wide and 2688 tall)
3) Larger than 8 megapixels (minimum 2160 wide and 3840 tall)
